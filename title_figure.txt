Figure 2. Memristors Overview. How memristors materials are distributed and their behaviours to electrical stimulus. 
A) Spatial distribution of memristors layers. The choice of silicon substrate can impact factors such as thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and integration with other semiconductor technologies, top and bottom electrodes establish electrical contact with the memristor and enable flow of current. Finally, Dioxide layers undergo reversible changes in its resistance in response to applied electric fields or currents (Image recreated from [93]) 
B) Current-Voltage characteristic curves of memristors, showcasing their hysteresis behaviour. Image “a” shows a bipolar state transition from high resistant to low. When the voltage is reduced back to zero and further int the negative range, the memristor remains in the LRS until the negative voltage exceeds a certain threshold, causing it to switch back to HRS (marked as "RESET (OFF)"). This creates a hysteresis loop, indicating the memory effect of the device.
 C) Memristive cross-bar arrays in SNN and Neuromorphic Computing. The convolution product needed in convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, is the most energy demanding process of the network. It can be naturally per-formed in a cross-bar array on the physical level based on Ohm and Kirchoff laws [12], [94].
